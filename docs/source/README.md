# The Public Transport Accessibility Project 
## Analysis for SDG Indicator 11.2.1

This project is to build a data pipeline to analyse data for the UN Sustainable Development Goal indicator 11.2.1, which is part of goal 11:

> "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable"

By assessing geographical and census data with data on public transport access points (stops and stations), an assessment can be made about the degree of acessability individuals in the population have to public transport. 


## Description of Target 11.2
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons 


## Description of Indicator 11.2.1
"Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities"


## Aims of the project

The aims are:

* to build a data pipeline that can analyse data to assess the availability of public transport services for the population of the UK
* to make the code reusable so that it may be able to analyse other data and:
    * assess the availability of other services across the UK
    * be used to assess the availability of services in other nations

## Deliverables of the project

1. Open source reuseable code which relies only on open source resources
2. A new dataset with analysis of public transport availability for the UK population
3. Three additional datasets with analysis of public transport availability disagregated by sex, age and disabilities
