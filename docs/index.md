# The Public Transport Accessibility Project 
## Analysis for SDG Indicator 11.2.1


This project is to build a data pipeline to analyse data for the UN Sustainable Development Goal indicator 11.2.1, which is part of goal 11:

> "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable"

By assessing geographical and census data with data on public transport access points (stops and stations), an assessment can be made about the degree of acessability individuals in the population have to public transport.
