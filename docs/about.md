# About the ONS SDG 11.2.1 project

This project has been created as side project by James Westwood, Antonio Felton, Paige Hunter and Nathan Shaw, with Musa Chirikeni as a geospatial adviser. All work on the project has been done in our self-development time on a voluntary basis. 

## Description of Target 11.2
By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons 


## Description of Indicator 11.2.1
"Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities"


## Aims of the project

The aims are:

* to build a data pipeline that can analyse data to assess the availability of public transport services for the population of the UK
* to make the code reusable so that it may be able to analyse other data and:
    * assess the availability of other services across the UK
    * be used to assess the availability of services in other nations


## Deliverables of the project

1. Open source reuseable code which relies only on open source resources
2. A new dataset with analysis of public transport availability for the UK population
3. Three additional datasets with analysis of public transport availability disagregated by sex, age and disabilities
